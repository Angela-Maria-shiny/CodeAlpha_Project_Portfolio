      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Angela Maria Shiny, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Computer
        Applications (BCA), and I have several certifications in Responsive Web
        Design, JavaScript, AWS Foundation and Front-End Development. My journey
        from customer care to front-end development has equipped me with a
        unique blend of technical expertise and a customer-centric approach. I
        excel at translating complex concepts into user-friendly interfaces that
        prioritize usability and accessibility.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With experience in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Figma, React Js, and in
        version control Git and GitHub I focus on building dynamic, responsive
        web applications. Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving CSS Grid, Flexbox,
        and JavaScript interactivity, including a dynamic image gallery,
        calculator clone amazon, E-commerece sites and a responsive dashboard
        design. I thrive in environments that require creative problem-solving
        and continuous learning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My customer care background has taught me the importance of
        understanding user needs, making me highly skilled at user research and
        creating intuitive, engaging solutions. I'm excited to further my career
        in front-end development by leveraging my technical skills and passion
        for delivering innovative digital experiences.
